  "BA_LATE": "Morning, Mr. Freeman. Looks like you're running late.",

  //c2p0 - Barney
  "BA_DESK": "Hey, Mr. Freeman. I had a bunch of messages for you, but we had a system crash about 20 minutes ago and I'm still trying to find my files. Just one of those days, I guess. They were having some problems down in the test chamber, too, but I think that's all straightened out. They told me to make sure you headed down there as soon as you got into your hazard suit.",
  "BA_BUTTON": "Come on, Gordon, are you trying to get me into trouble?",
  "BA_HEADDOWN": "You got the wrong airlock, Mr. Freeman. You know I can't let you through here.",
  "BA_HEVNO": "Sorry, Mr. Freeman, I got explicit orders not to let you through without your hazard suit on.",
  "BA_HEVYES": "Go right on through sir. Looks like you're in the barrel today.",

  //c2p0 - Scientist
  "SC_GETAWAY": "Get away from there, Freeman! I'm expecting an important message!",
  "SC_GMORN": "Good morning, Gordon",
  "SC_BIGDAY": "Big day today, Freeman.",
  "SC_SAMPLE": "The sample was just delivered to the test chamber.",

  "SC_CTRL1A": "Ah, Gordon. Here you are. We just sent the sample down to the test chamber.",
  "SC_CTRL2A": "We boosted the anti-mass spectrometer to 105 percent. Bit of a gamble, but we need the extra resolution.",
  "SC_CTRL3A": "The administrator is very concerned that we get a conclusive analysis of today's sample. I gather they went to some length to get it.",
  "SC_CTRL4A": "They're waiting for you, Gordon, in the test chamber.",

  "SC_CRIT1A": "Quick! It's about to go critical!",
  "SC_CRIT2A": "What the hell is going on with our equipment?",
  "SC_CRIT3A": "It wasn't meant to do this in the first place.",

  "SC_LOCK1A": "I'm afraid we'll be deviating a bit from standard analysis procedures today, Gordon.",
  "SC_LOCK2A": "Yes, but with good reason. This is a rare opportunity for us. This is the purest sample we've seen yet.",
  "SC_LOCK3A": "And, potentially, the most unstable.",
  "SC_LOCK4A": "No, no. If you follow standard insertion procedure, everything will be fine.",
  "SC_LOCK5A": "I don't know how you can say that. Although I will admit that the possibility of a resonance cascade scenario is extremely unlikely--",
  "SC_LOCK6A": "Gordon doesn't need to hear all this, he's a highly trained professional. We've assured the administrator that nothing will go wrong.",
  "SC_LOCK7A": "Ah... yes, you're right. Gordon, we have complete confidence in you.",
  "SC_LOCK8A": "Well, go ahead. Let's let him in now."
