  "BA_DESK": "<clr:215,255,255>Hey, Mr. Freeman. I had a bunch of messages for you, but we had a system crash about 20 minutes ago and I'm still trying to find my files. Just one of those days, I guess. They were having some problems down in the test chamber, too, but I think that's all straightened out. They told me to make sure you headed down there as soon as you got into your hazard suit. ",
  "BA_BUTTON": "<clr:215,255,255>Come on, Gordon, are you trying to get me into trouble? ",

  "SC_CTRL1A": "<clr:255,255,200>Ah, Gordon. Here you are. We just sent the sample down to the test chamber. ",
  "SC_CTRL2A": "<clr:255,255,200>We boosted the anti-mass spectrometer to 105 percent. Bit of a gamble, but we need the extra resolution. ",
  "SC_CTRL3A": "<clr:255,255,200>The administrator is very concerned that we get a conclusive analysis of today's sample. I gather they went to some length to get it. ",
  "SC_CTRL4A": "<clr:255,255,200>They're waiting for you, Gordon, in the test chamber. ",

  "SC_CRIT1A": "<clr:255,255,200>Quick! It's about to go critical! ",
  "SC_CRIT2A": "<clr:255,255,200>What the hell is going on with our equipment? ",
  "SC_CRIT3A": "<clr:255,255,200>It wasn't meant to do this in the first place. ",

  "SC_LOCK1A": "<clr:255,255,200>I'm afraid we'll be deviating a bit from standard analysis procedures today, Gordon. ",
  "SC_LOCK2A": "<clr:255,255,200>Yes, but with good reason. This is a rare opportunity for us. This is the purest sample we've seen yet. ",
  "SC_LOCK3A": "<clr:255,255,200>And, potentially, the most unstable. ",
  "SC_LOCK4A": "<clr:255,255,200>No, no. If you follow standard insertion procedure, everything will be fine. ",
  "SC_LOCK5A": "<clr:255,255,200>I don't know how you can say that. Although I will admit that the possibility of a resonance cascade scenario is extremely unlikely-- ",
  "SC_LOCK6A": "<clr:255,255,200>Gordon doesn't need to hear all this, he's a highly trained professional. We've assured the administrator that nothing will go wrong. ",
  "SC_LOCK7A": "<clr:255,255,200>Ah... yes, you're right. Gordon, we have complete confidence in you. ",
  "SC_LOCK8A": "<clr:255,255,200>Well, go ahead. Let's let him in now. ",

  "SC_DISA": "<clr:255,255,200><I>[Feedback] Testing, testing. [Coughs] Everything seems to be in order. ",
  "SC_DIS1A": "<clr:255,255,200><I>All right, Gordon. Your suit should keep you comfortable through all this. The specimen will be delivered to you in a few moments. If you would be so good as to climb up and start the rotors, we can bring the anti-mass spectrometer to 80 percent and hold it there until the carrier arrives. ",
  "SC_DIS1B": "<clr:255,255,200><I>Gordon, are you not hearing me? Climb up and start the rotors, please. ",
  "SC_DIS1C": "<clr:255,255,200><I>Climb up and start the rotors. ",
  "SC_DIS1D": "<clr:255,255,200><I>Very good. We'll take it from here. ",

  "SC_DIS3A": "<clr:255,255,200><I>I'm seeing predictable phase arrays. ",
  "SC_DIS4A": "<clr:255,255,200><I>Tell him to stand back from the focal stage. That suit won't do him any goodif he wanders into the beam. ",
  "SC_DIS5A": "<clr:255,255,200><I>Stage 2 emitters activating... now. ",
  "SC_DIS6A": "<clr:255,255,200><I>I've just been informed that the sample is ready, Gordon. It should be coming up to you any moment now. Look to the delivery system for your specimen. ",
  "SC_DIS7A": "<clr:255,255,200><I>Standard insertion for a none standard specimen. Go ahead, Gordon. Slope the carrier it to the analysis port. ",
  "SC_DIS9A": "<clr:255,255,200><I>Overhead capacitors to 105 percent. ",
  "SC_DIS10A": "<clr:255,255,200><I>Gordon, we cannot predict how long the system can operate at this level, nor how long the readings will take. Please, work as quickly as you can. ",
  "SC_DIS11A": "<clr:255,255,200><I>Uh, it's probably not a problem, probably, but I'm showing a small discrepancy in... well, no, it's well within acceptable bounds again. Sustaining sequence. ",
  "SC_DIS12A": "<clr:255,255,200><I>Nothing you need to worry about, Gordon. That's it, go ahead. ",
  "SC_DIS13A": "<clr:255,255,200><I>W-what is he doing in there? ",
  "SC_DIS14A": "<clr:255,255,200><I>Get him out of there! Shut down the equipment and someone get him out! ",
  "SC_DIS15A": "<clr:255,255,200><I>Shutting down... Attempted shutdown... It's not-it's not, it's not shutting down! It's not-- ",
  "SC_DIS16A": "<clr:255,255,200><I>Gordon, get away from the beams! ",
